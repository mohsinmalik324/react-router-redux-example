A really short example of using react with react-router and react-redux. If you want to run this project, just clone it and run **yarn start** from the root.

There are two pages: one page to add an item and one page that lists those items.

The only reason I created this was to learn how to use redux with react, and I thought the best way was to also use react-router as that seems to be a common scenario of the best time to use redux in react.
